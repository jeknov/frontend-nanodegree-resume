## Interactive Personal Resume

Completed as a project for the [Javascript Basics course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804) at Udacity.

### Work Process:
The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with biographical information. I had to:

1. Build four JSONs, each one representing a different resume section. Made sure my JSONs are formatted correctly using <a href="http://jsonlint.com/" target="_blank">JSONlint.com</a>.
2. Iterate through each JSON and append its information to index.html in the correct section using jQuery.
3. Add an interactive map. 
4. All of my code for adding elements are within functions. And all of my functions are encapsulated within the same objects containing my resume data. 
5. My resume also has `console.log()` information about click locations (in helper.js)

### By the end:
My interactive resume looks like this
